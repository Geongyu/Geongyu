## 👋 Hi, I'm Geongyu Lee  
**AI Scientist | Computational Pathology & Multi-Omics**

## 🚀 From Pixels to Proteins  
*Bridging histopathology, proteomics, and clinical signals with AI.*

I am an AI researcher working at the intersection of **computational pathology** and  
**multi-omics modeling**. My research focuses on extracting phenotypic representations  
from **gigapixel whole-slide histopathology images (WSIs)** and connecting them to  
**proteomic, molecular, and clinical outcomes** for translational research and drug discovery.

My work emphasizes scalable WSI analysis, representation learning, and multimodal  
integration toward **clinically meaningful and interpretable AI systems**.
