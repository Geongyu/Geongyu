## 👋 Hi, I'm Geongyu Lee  
**AI Scientist | Computational Pathology & Multi-Omics**

AI researcher working at the intersection of **computational pathology** and **multi-omics modeling**.  
I develop deep learning models that extract phenotypic information from **whole-slide histopathology images (WSIs)** and connect them to **clinical and proteomic outcomes** for translational research and drug discovery.

My work focuses on scalable WSI analysis, representation learning, and multimodal integration for clinically meaningful AI systems.
